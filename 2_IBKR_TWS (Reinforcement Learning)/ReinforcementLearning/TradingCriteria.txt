# Major Factors to take into consideration.
1. Each position - 1000 Units; 0.01 lots  
2. Trading Cost - 0.062 USD (refer below)
3. Starting Capital - 1,000 USD


Trading Cost:
1 Lot = 100,000 EUR

100,000 = 6.2 usd to close
10,000 = 0.62 usd to close
1000 = 0.062 usd to close.
We want only 0.062, thus buy costs 0.031, and close costs 0.031, totalling 0.062. use 0.031 on each open and close position

Other Notes:
1. Scale Trading Cost
