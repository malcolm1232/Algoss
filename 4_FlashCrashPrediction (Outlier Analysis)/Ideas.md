Let me know if you want:

1. to calculate buy vs sell ticks based on bid/ask movement (done)
2. a rolling tick volume window (done)

3. merging this with order book depth info (if you get it)
Would you like to:
    Flag "burst" minutes where tick volume is above normal?
    Detect when pip change > 1 (e.g., jumps due to news)?
   


Other personal ideas:
1. Eg. too many buy ticks, means high buying pressure?
2. Identify Velocity


### To Do
1. Sell when velocity beginning to drop, and
2. use tick and minute data to predict 15min sell based on sell pressure crash?
3. Create Portf. Analyser, alpha etc.
4. And Actual Price actions on chart. and buy label circle etc. and sell.
